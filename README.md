In this challenge I created a dashboard that uses data from The Public Science Lab's dataset regarding the types of bacteria that live in bellybuttons. I read in the JSON data using d3, and then used javascript to create charts that look at the top OTUs for each individual in different ways. We also display the metadata of the selected individual. I added a drop-down that allows you to select the ID of the individual, and the charts update accordingly.
